# AutoMart_UI

Auto Mart is an online marketplace for automobiles of diverse make, model or body type. With Auto Mart, users can sell their cars or buy either brand new or used cars from trusted dealerships or private sellers.

This is Challenge 4 of my ADC (Andela Developer Challenge) project which I started in this Repo, [**AutoMart**](https://github.com/chuksjoe/AutoMart). This previous Repo covers challenge 1 to 3 of this project which I will be wrapping up in this current Repo.

In the [**AutoMart**](https://github.com/chuksjoe/AutoMart) Repo, I created and implemented the API endpoints for all the activities on the AutoMart platform as specified in the ADC guidelines, and also added some more endpoints that were not specified, but are relevant from my perspective. I also consumed some of these endpoints on the frontend section of this Repo. The frontend together with the API are hosted on heroku and can be accessed [**here.**](https://auto-mart-adc.herokuapp.com)

For this phase of my ADC project, I will be developing a new UI that will consume all the endpoints developed in challenge 3 of this project, and will be deploying it to Github pages.
